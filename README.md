# A single-cell time-resolved profiling of Xenopus mucociliary epithelium reveals non-hierarchical model of development
![Graphical Abstract](figs/graphicabstract.png)

In this work, we investigate the mucociliary epithelial development in _Xenopus laevis_ through time-course single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 33,900 single-cells over 10 developmental stages.  

This work provides.  
**_I._** Detailed understanding developmental transitions at single-cell level during functional mucociliary epithelial development and differentiation  
**_II._** Insights into cell fate paradigms during developing mucociliary epithelial development  
**_III._** Comparative evolutionary developmental comparison across lower and higher vertebrates through systematic comparison of 9 single-cell transcriptomics atlases.  

The raw dataset is deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO:GSE158088). This repository consists all the analysis notebooks for reproducing the analysis.   
The single-cell transcriptomics data and metadata can be downloaded for offline visualization or interactively visualized at https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/d4055728-b22d-4851-b12d-d7bd0216e8c4.
