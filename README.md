# A single-cell time-resolved profiling of Xenopus mucociliary epithelium reveals non-hierarchical model of development
![Graphical Abstract](figs/graphical_abstract.png)

Here, we investigate the mucociliary epithelial development in _Xenopus laevis_ through time-course single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 33,990 single-cells over 10 developmental stages.  

This work provides:  <br/>
- Understanding of single-cell developmental transitions during functional mucociliary epithelial development and differentiation
- Insights into cell fate decisions during developing mucociliary epithelial development
- Comparative evolutionary comparisons across vertebrates through comparison of 9 single-cell transcriptomics atlases.

The raw dataset is deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (_GEO:GSE158088_). This repository consists all the analysis notebooks for reproducing the analysis.   <br/><br/>
The single-cell transcriptomics data and metadata can be downloaded for offline visualization or interactively visualized at [CellxGene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/d4055728-b22d-4851-b12d-d7bd0216e8c4) or [UCSC Cell Browser](https://cells-test.gi.ucsc.edu/?ds=xenopus-dev).  <br/>
