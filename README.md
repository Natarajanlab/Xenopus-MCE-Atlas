# A single-cell time-resolved profiling of Xenopus mucociliary epithelium reveals non-hierarchical model of development
![Graphical Abstract](figs/graphical_abstract.png)

In this work, we investigate the mucociliary epithelial development in _Xenopus laevis_ through time-course single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 33,990 single-cells over 10 developmental stages.  

This work provides:  <br/>
- **I.** Detailed understanding developmental transitions at single-cell level during functional mucociliary epithelial development and differentiation
- **II.** Insights into cell fate paradigms during developing mucociliary epithelial development
- **III.** Comparative evolutionary developmental comparison across lower and higher vertebrates through systematic comparison of 9 single-cell transcriptomics atlases.

The raw dataset is deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (_GEO:GSE158088_). This repository consists all the analysis notebooks for reproducing the analysis.   <br/>
The single-cell transcriptomics data and metadata can be downloaded for offline visualization or interactively visualized at https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/d4055728-b22d-4851-b12d-d7bd0216e8c4.  <br/>
_Note: The web version only displays orthologous human gene identifiers over UMAP. The downloadable version include Xenopus gene identifiers, knn-graph coordinates and cell type annotations._
